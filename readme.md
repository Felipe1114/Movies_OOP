## Data Handling

- The movie data is fetched from the OMDb API. However, since the API data does not always have the correct format, values are converted before being stored.
- If a value cannot be converted correctly (e.g., `year: 2012-2013`to an `int`), a default value is assigned to prevent errors.

## Storage

- Users can choose between storing movie data in a JSON or CSV file.
- However, there is currently no functionality to change the storage format during runtime.
- The default storage is `json`.
